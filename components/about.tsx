      <div className="text-white flex-wrap mb-3">
        I am a passionate back-end and front-end developer based in Saint Louis, Missouri. I take pleasure in learning new technologies, and view each project as a creative challenge.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey started back in 2011 when I built custom programs on my TI-84 and small python applications to help me with day-to-day tasks. Fast-forward through high school and graduating Saint Louis University with a degree in Computer Science; it&apos;s easy to see that my interest in software development has not waned.
        <br />
        <br />
        My professional and personal career has led me to opportunities such as full-stack development on an enterprise tech-stack, experimenting with my own file management API, building various Unity and Godot games, constructing and managing a discord management bot used on servers with hundreds of users, and even crafting the website you&apos;re looking at.
        <br />
        <br />
        When not working on software development, I am often found writing stories set in fantastical lands, going on (mis)adventures with friends, and running from hordes of blocky zombies while mining diamonds.
