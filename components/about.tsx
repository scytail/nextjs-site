      <div className="text-white flex-wrap">
        I am a full-stack developer based in Saint Louis, Missouri. I take immense pleasure in learning new technologies, and view each new project as a unique challenge.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey started back in 2011 with building custom programs on my TI-84 and building small python applications to help me with day-to-day tasks. Fast-forward through high school and graduating Saint Louis University with a degree in Computer Science, and my interest in software development has not waned.
        <br />
        <br />
        My professional and personal career has led me to full-stack development on an enterprise tech-stack, experimenting with building my own file management API, building various unity and godot games, constructing and managing a discord management bot used on servers with hundreds of users, and even crafting the custom-built website you're looking at.
        <br />
        <br />
        When not working on software development, I am often found writing stories set in fantastical lands, going on (mis)adventures with friends, and running from hordes of  blocky zombies.
