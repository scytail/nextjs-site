This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Ensure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and NPM are installed. This can be verified by running the following commands:
```bash
node -v; npm -v
```

Once installed, the packages required to run the server can be installed via NPM:
```bash
npm install package.json
```

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
